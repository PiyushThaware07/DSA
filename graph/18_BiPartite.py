Problem Statement: Check if a Graph is Bipartite
You are given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list, 
where each node is labeled from 0 to n-1.
Your task is to determine if the given graph is bipartite.

A graph is bipartite if:
    1. Its vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets, such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.
    2. It is possible to color the graph using two colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

class Solution:
    def dfs(self, node, color, visited, graph):
        visited[node] = color
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            # If the neighbor has not been visited
            if visited[neighbor] == -1:
                # Recursively call DFS with the opposite color
                if self.dfs(neighbor, 1 - color, visited, graph) == False:
                    return False
            # If the neighbor is visited and has the same color
            elif visited[neighbor] == color:
                return False
        return True

    def isBipartite(self, graph):
        visited = {node: -1 for node in graph}  # Initialize all nodes as unvisited
        for node in graph:
            if visited[node] == -1:  # If the node has not been visited
                if not self.dfs(node, 0, visited, graph):
                    print("Graph is not bipartite!")
                    return
        print("Graph is bipartite!")
        return
