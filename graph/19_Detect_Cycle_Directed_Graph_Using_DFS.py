'''
Problem Statement : Detect cycle in directed graph using dfs.

Logic:
* Mark the current node as visited and part of the recursion path.
* For each neighbor of the node:
    -> If the neighbor is unvisited, recursively call dfs.
    -> If the neighbor is already in the recursion path (pathVisited[node] == 1), a cycle is detected.
* After visiting all neighbors, mark the node as no longer part of the recursion path.
* Return False if no cycle is detected.
