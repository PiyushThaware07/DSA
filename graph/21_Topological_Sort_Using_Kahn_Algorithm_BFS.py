'''
Topological Sorting Using Kahn's Algorithm

* Create a dictionary inDegree to store the number of incoming edges (dependencies) for each node.
        Iterate over all nodes in the adjacency list and update the in-degree for each neighbor.

* Find all nodes with no incoming edges (inDegree = 0) and add them to a queue.
* Pop a node from the queue, add it to the result list, and process its neighbors:
    For each neighbor, decrement its inDegree by 1.
        If the neighbor's inDegree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
