Problem Statement : Spanning Tree

Spanning Tree is a tree in which we have n-nodes and n-1 edges and all the nodes are reachable from each other.

0 - 1 - 2
|  /|  /
|/  | / 
3   5
No of nodes -> 5
No of edges -> 6

Its spanning tree are -
0 - 1 - 2
|   |
3   5

0 - 1 - 2

  3   5
  


# Minimum Spanning Tree : Any tree with least sum of its edges it is called minimum spanning tree.
