Topological Sorting :

Problem Description:
Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) represented as an adjacency list, your task is to perform Topological Sorting on the graph. 
Topological sorting of a DAG is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge u → v, vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering

5 → 0 ← 4
↓       ↓
2 → 3 → 1

Adjancency List = {
    5 -> 0,
    5 -> 2,
    4 -> 0,
    2 -> 3,
    3 -> 1,
    4 -> 1
}

topological sorting means "U" should appears before "V" as follows
possible sort - 1 : 542310
possible sort - 2 : 452310
