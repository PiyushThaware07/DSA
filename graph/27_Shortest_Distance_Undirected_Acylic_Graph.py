Problem Statement: Shortest Distance In Undirected Acyclic Grapph With Unit Weights (i.e 1 for all paths).

You are given an undirected graph with n nodes and m edges. The graph is represented as a list of edges, 
where each edge is a pair of integers [u, v], indicating an edge between node u and node v. 
Your task is to calculate the shortest distance from a given source node to all other nodes in the graph. 
If a node is not reachable from the source node, its distance should be -1.
