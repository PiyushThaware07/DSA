'''
Valid Stack Sequence

Given two integer arrays pushed and popped each with distinct values, return true if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or false otherwise.
Example : 
    Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
    Output: true
    Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
    push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),
    pop() -> 4,
    push(5),
    pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1

        3. if stack is still not empty then return "invalid sequence" else it will return a "valid sequence"
