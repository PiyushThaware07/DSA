Isomorphic Strings


Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
    Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
    Output: true
    Explanation : 
        s = "e g g"
        t = "a d d"
        1. replace e by d in s
        s = "a g g"
        2. replace g by d in s
        s = "a d g"
        3. replace g by d in s 
        s = "a d d"

Example 2 : 
    Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
    Output: false
    Explanation : 
        s = "f o o"
        t = "b a r"
        1. replace f by b in s
        s = "b o o" 
        2. replace o by a in s 
        s = "b a o"
        3. replace o by r in s by since in step-2 "o->a" so modification not allowed
        s = "b a o"
        therefore it is not isomorphic
