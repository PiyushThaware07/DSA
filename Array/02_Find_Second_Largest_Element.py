Find the second largest element in an array
1. Brute Force
2. Better
3. Optimized

Example 1 : [1,2,3,4,5] 
--> In this example as there is no repetation of number so the second largest will be n-2

Example 2 : [1,2,3,4,4,5,5]
--> In this example as the numbers are repeating so the n-2 => 5 it is not the second largest the second largest must be unique so what we can do we can start iteration from n-2 check it with the largest if it is not equal then that was the second largest element of an array.
