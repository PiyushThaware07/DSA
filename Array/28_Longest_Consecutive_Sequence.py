'''
Longest Consecutive Sequence --> Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
        Output: 4
        randomly pickedup 1 then 1+1 => 2 present then 2+1 => 3 present and so on.
        Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
        Output: 9
