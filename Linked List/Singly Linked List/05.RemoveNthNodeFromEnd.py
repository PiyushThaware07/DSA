'''
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Example :
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

        Add a Dummy Node -> Create a dummy node and link it to the head of the list.
        Initialize Pointers -> Set two pointers, slow and fast, to point to the dummy node.
        Move fast Pointer -> Advance the fast pointer n + 1 steps ahead.
        If fast becomes None during this process, it means n exceeds the length of the list.
        Traverse the List -> Move both fast and slow pointers one step at a time until fast reaches the end of the list.
        At this point, the slow pointer will be just before the node to be removed.
        Remove the Target Node -> Update the next pointer of the slow node to skip the target node.
        Update the Head -> Reassign the head of the list to dummy.next in case the removed node was the original head.
        Traverse the Updated List -> Display the updated linked list using a traversal method.
