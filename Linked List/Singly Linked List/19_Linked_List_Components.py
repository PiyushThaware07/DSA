PROBLEM STATEMENT : Linked List Components

Example - 1:
Input: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.


Example - 2: 
Input: head = [0,1,2,3,4], nums = [0,3,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
