# Recursion
### Defination : When a function call itself util a specific condition mets it is called recursion.

### Stack Overflow : Stack Overflow is an error or condition that occurs when the call stack in a program exceeds its maximum size or capacity. This typically happens in scenarios of uncontrolled or excessive recursion or deeply nested function calls.

### Stack Underflow : Stack Underflow is a condition that occurs when an attempt is made to pop (or access) an element from an empty stack.

## Types Of Recursion : 
1. Parameterized Recursion -> In parameterized recursion, the parameters of the function carry the computation's state as arguments.
2. In functional recursion, the function works directly with its return value.Instead of explicitly passing state through parameters, the recursive calls return values that the function processes further.
